# Web Developer Applicant Challenge
In this challenge, you will create a basic website for the Department of Dance. This should replicate a
real-life scenario of working with a client to meet their requests and expectations.
You may brainstorm and plan as needed prior to building the site. To start the challenge, send an email
to cfacpr@byu.edu with the text similar to “My name is [your name]. I am beginning the Web Developer
Challenge.” Please email cfacpr@byu.edu within 24 hours with your files to submit your challenge.

Requirements:
Create a basic website using Wordpress, Wix, HTML/CSS/Javascript or another website builder. This
will act as a pretend website for the Department of Dance. We encourage you not to copy the existing
Dance website, but to use your own creativity and design skills for your faux BYU Dance website
instead. You may use whatever images you like, and text may simply be Lorem Ipsum. The website
must have a minimum of 3 pages: a homepage, an about page, and a form page.
The homepage - must provide links to the other 2 web pages.
The about page - must simulate a faculty page that showcases at least 3 faculty members. For each
faculty member, you should include an image and some text.
The form page - should resemble a dance audition application. The form should request basic
information such as name, email, and phone number. Include any other fields you think may be
important for an audition form.
Each page must include a header and footer.
Package all files in one folder, zip and send to cfacpr@byu.edu within 24 hours of beginning the
challenge. (You may also send us a link to Github if you would like).

Alternative:
1. Figure out how to build a very simple yet functioning WordPress theme using the WordPress
codex at https://codex.wordpress.org/. The theme does not need to be anything complicated;
however, it must be able to display posts and pages; the website should meet all the same
criteria as listed above.
2. Package your theme in a zip file, and send it by email to cfacpr@byu.edu
3. This must be time-stamped and completed in 24 hours.
